<h1>The Best Movies According to Jacobi</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Kill Bill (Vol. 1 &2)</h3>
<p>The movie is pure cinema through an through, from the plot, to the camera angles, engaging backstories, and well choreographed action scenes. On top of all this, the cast is superb and it right in to the story like it was their own life. If you asked me to rank both, I'd have to say Vol. 1 was the better movie overall, but Vol.2 is not far off.</p>
<br />
<h3>2. The Friday Trilogy </h3>
<p> Now, maybe I'm a sucker for a low budget production film that becomes cult classic and defines a generation and culture in a hilarious way, but the Friday trilogy through and through has helped bring laughter no matter how many times I watch it. It never ceases to make me laugh and for that reason alone, it stands at number two on my list.</p>
<br />
<h3>3.Napoleon Dynamite</h3>
<p> Napoleon Dynamite gets the number 3 nod thanks to its uniqueness and replay value. This movie has stood the test of time and culture shifts, still invoking a smile and laughter throuhout the movie. This movie will stick with you and have you reciting the many hilarious scene as you go about life. </p>
